# QGIS Ribbon

QGIS Ribbon is an open-source plugin based on the wonderful work of the polish [GIAP-PolaMap(lite)](https://github.com/GIAPspzoo/GIAP_PolaMap_lite) team. It has been cleaned out from all the polish GIAP features just keeping the ribbon.

The defaut custom styles have been removed in order to keep users settings.

The 'Show menu' feature works only on Windows and Linux since menus cannot be hidden under macOS.

## Customization of toolbar
The plugin enables to personalize the toolbar by adding new tabs and sections.
