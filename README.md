# QGIS Ribbon

QGIS Ribbon is an open-source plugin based on the wonderful work of GIAP-PolaMap(lite). It has been cleaned out from all the polish GIAP features just keeping the ribbon.
This plugin allows toolbar customization inside QGIS.

The defaut custom styles have been removed in order to keep users settings.

## Customization of toolbar
The plugin has the ability to personalize the toolbar by adding new tabs and sections with QGIS.
